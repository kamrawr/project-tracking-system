# GitHub Publishing Blueprint
## Digital Project Tracking System â€“ One-Shot Deployment Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating a GitHub repository and publishing the Digital Project Tracking System as a live GitHub Pages site.

## Prerequisites

- Git installed on your local machine
- A GitHub account
- Basic familiarity with Git commands

## Overview

You will:
1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Clone it locally
3. Add the application files
4. Configure for GitHub Pages
5. Push and publish

The entire process takes about 5-10 minutes. The result is a public, live website that anyone can access.

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Create the GitHub Repository

1. Log into GitHub at [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the **New repository** button (green button in top-right, or via your profile)
3. Configure the repository:
   - **Repository name**: `project-tracking-system` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: "Multi-partner project tracking with event sourcing and rules engine"
   - **Visibility**: Choose **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - **Initialize**: Check âœ… "Add a README file" to create the default branch
4. Click **Create repository**

GitHub will create your repository with a default `main` branch and an initial README.

### 2. Clone the Repository Locally

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/project-tracking-system.git
cd project-tracking-system
```

Replace `<your-username>` with your actual GitHub username.

### 3. Add the Application Files

Copy the files from this directory into your cloned repository:

```bash
# If you're in the project-tracking-system directory created in step 2
cp /path/to/index.html .
cp /path/to/README.md .
cp /path/to/.nojekyll .
```

**Important**: The HTML file MUST be named `index.html` for GitHub Pages to work correctly.

Your directory structure should now look like:
```
project-tracking-system/
â”œâ”€â”€ .nojekyll
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### 4. Disable Jekyll Processing

The `.nojekyll` file you copied tells GitHub Pages **not** to run Jekyll builds. This is essential because:

- Your site uses custom HTML/JavaScript
- Jekyll processing can interfere with your application
- Static files should be served as-is

The `.nojekyll` file should be empty (zero bytes) and placed in the repository root.

**Verification**: Run `ls -la` and confirm you see `.nojekyll` in the file list.

### 5. Update the README (Optional)

The `README.md` file is already comprehensive, but you may want to customize it with:

- Your organization's name
- Specific use case information
- Custom deployment URLs
- Additional setup instructions

Edit `README.md` in any text editor and save your changes.

### 6. Commit and Push

Stage all files and commit them:

```bash
git add .nojekyll index.html README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit: Digital Project Tracking System"
git push origin main
```

This uploads your files to GitHub.

### 7. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/<your-username>/project-tracking-system`
2. Click **Settings** (tab near the top of the page)
3. In the left sidebar, scroll to **Code and automation** section
4. Click **Pages**
5. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - **Source**: Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - **Branch**: Select `main`
   - **Folder**: Select `/ (root)`
6. Click **Save**

GitHub will begin building your site. This typically takes 1-3 minutes.

### 8. Verify Your Live Site

1. Stay on the Pages settings page
2. After a minute, refresh the page
3. You'll see a message: **"Your site is live at https://\<your-username\>.github.io/project-tracking-system/"**
4. Click **Visit site** to open your live application

ðŸŽ‰ **Success!** Your Digital Project Tracking System is now publicly accessible.

---

## Your Site URL

Your site will be available at:

```
https://<your-username>.github.io/project-tracking-system/
```

Share this URL with stakeholders, team members, or anyone who needs access to the system.

---

## Optional Enhancements

### Custom Domain

If you own a domain name:

1. On the Pages settings page, enter your domain under **Custom domain**
2. Click **Save**
3. Configure DNS records with your domain provider:
   - Add a `CNAME` record pointing to `<your-username>.github.io`
   - Or add `A` records pointing to GitHub's IP addresses
4. GitHub will automatically provision an SSL certificate

See [GitHub's custom domain documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) for detailed instructions.

### GitHub Actions Deployment

For more control, you can deploy via GitHub Actions instead of "deploy from branch":

1. On the Pages settings, select **Source: GitHub Actions**
2. Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with a static site deployment workflow
3. Commit and push the workflow file

This allows custom build steps, automated testing, or multi-environment deployments.

### Version Tagging

Tag releases to create snapshots:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial release"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

Tags appear under **Releases** in GitHub and provide version history.

### Private Repository

If you need a private repository but still want to use GitHub Pages:

- Upgrade to GitHub Pro, Team, or Enterprise
- Private repository Pages are available on paid plans
- Follow the same setup steps as above

## Maintenance & Updates

### Making Changes

To update your live site:

1. Edit files locally
2. Commit changes: `git commit -am "Update: description of changes"`
3. Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`
4. GitHub Pages automatically rebuilds (1-3 minutes)

### Monitoring Deployments

Check deployment status:

1. Go to your repository
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. View the Pages deployment history

Each commit to `main` triggers a new deployment.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Site Not Loading

- **Check Pages settings**: Verify branch is set to `main` and folder is `/ (root)`
- **Wait for build**: Allow 3-5 minutes after enabling Pages
- **Check Actions tab**: Look for build errors
- **Verify .nojekyll**: Ensure the file exists in repository root

### 404 Errors

- **File must be `index.html`**: GitHub Pages looks for this exact filename
- **Case-sensitive paths**: Ensure proper capitalization in file references
- **Root directory**: HTML file must be in repository root (not a subdirectory)

### JavaScript Not Working

- **Browser console**: Open DevTools (F12) and check for errors
- **HTTPS required**: Some features need secure context
- **Browser compatibility**: Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari

### Jekyll Warnings

- **Add .nojekyll**: The empty file disables Jekyll processing
- **Remove _config.yml**: Delete any Jekyll configuration files
- **Check build logs**: Actions tab shows detailed build output

---

## Security Considerations

### Public Repository

- **No secrets**: Never commit API keys, passwords, or sensitive data
- **Client-side only**: All processing happens in the browser
- **Static content**: No server-side execution means minimal attack surface

### Access Control

GitHub Pages sites are public. For access control:

- Use a private repository (paid plans)
- Add authentication via external service (Auth0, Firebase)
- Host on a private server instead

---

## Next Steps

After your site is live:

1. **Share the URL** with your team and stakeholders
2. **Test all features**, especially the interactive playground
3. **Customize content** to match your specific use case
4. **Add analytics** (Google Analytics, Plausible) to track usage
5. **Gather feedback** and iterate on the design
